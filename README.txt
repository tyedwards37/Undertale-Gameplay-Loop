Project: Undertale Gameplay Loop
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: Reproduce the Undertale gameplay loop in Python.

Language: Python (Pygame)

Reason: I enjoy Undertale and want to test my ability to create a functioning gameplay loop.

Plan: 
        1. Research Pygame implementation.
        2. Design the basic sprites.
        3. Figure out a basic enemy attack pattern.
        4. Write code for just the enemy attack loop in Python.
        5. Test the code and make sure this rudementary version functions properly.  
        6. Write code for the user's gameplay options.
        7. Add new enemy attacks and randomization of their order.
        8. Make any minor adjustments and potentially add more enemies with new attacks.
